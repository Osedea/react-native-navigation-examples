# React Native Navigation Examples

⚠️ As most of these examples use React Native 0.57.2, you'll surely need to start the packager manually with the `--reset-cache` option, as specified in this issue: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/21490

```sh
# Go in the folder of the navigation you want to test
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

Slides of my original Talk at Let's React Montreal - March 2018 that made me originally create these examples are [there](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V_SRpI1aUFY9b7rWP2ZV4zP0KLc8eb4GJONF2HWK31Y/edit?usp=sharing)
